# d3NutrApp

For our final project in COMP790 - Information Visualization, we are utlilizing d3 to create a Nutrition App that tracks macronutrient intake. <br /> 

- We obtained recommended intake levels for calories, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/dietary-guidelines/previous-dietary-guidelines/2015/advisory-report/appendix-e-3/appendix-e-31a4 <br />
- We have almost 8.8k different foods and their corresponding macronutrient levels per serving, obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/nutritional-values-for-common-foods-and-products?resource=download <br />
<br />
To run locally: <br />
